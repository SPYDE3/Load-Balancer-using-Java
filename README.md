Java Load Balancer Simulation ⚖️💻

This project is a Java-based Load Balancer Simulation that demonstrates how a load balancer distributes client requests to multiple servers using different load balancing algorithms.
It includes a Swing-based GUI 🎨 for real-time monitoring and control.

✨ Features
Three Load Balancing Algorithms ⚙️

🔄 Round Robin – Requests are distributed evenly in a circular order.
📉 Least Connections – Requests are assigned to the server with the fewest active connections.
🔢 IP Hashing – Requests are mapped to servers based on the client IP hash.
Auto-Scaling 📈📉
Automatically adds or removes server threads based on the average number of pending requests per server.

Socket Programming 🌐
Uses Java Sockets to send serialized UserRequest objects from clients to the load balancer.

Thread-based Server Simulation 🧵
Each server runs on its own thread and processes incoming requests from a shared BlockingQueue.

Swing GUI 🖥️
A Matrix-style control panel 💚🖤 that allows:

➕ Adding/removing servers manually
🔄 Switching between algorithms
🚀 Toggling auto-scaling ON/OFF
📊 Viewing real-time stats: current algorithm, total running servers, total requests handled
🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used
Java Socket Programming

📡 ServerSocket for listening to incoming client connections
📦 ObjectOutputStream / ObjectInputStream for sending and receiving serialized objects
Object Serialization

📄 UserRequest objects are serialized and sent over the network
Multithreading

🧵 Each server is a separate thread
🚚 Dispatcher thread in the load balancer distributes requests to the appropriate server
BlockingQueue (LinkedBlockingQueue)

🗃️ Used to store incoming requests and allow thread-safe processing
Swing GUI

🎛️ JFrame, JButton, JToggleButton, JLabel for the control panel
🎨 Styled with Matrix 💚 / black 🖤 theme
